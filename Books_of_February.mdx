## [Book 1: Building a StoryBrand; Donald Miller](https://amzn.to/3Ykdg4i)

Donald Miller attempts to explain us the readers why stories are important; whether it is in your life or business stories are essential part of the human experience. The book deals a lot with how one as an individual or a company can use the StoryBrand-7 framework to convey the core principles of a business to the customers. Simply put, for any business the customer is the protagonist, a hero whose problems need to be solved, but you as a business should be the guide and the book gives you instructions how to clearly and effectively convey the thoughts of a business and how will it enable the protagonist to survive and thrive. With seven easy to use principles, you the hero can provide your service as a guide to the next hero (the customer). Highly useful if you are starting a business or you want to rebrand it to convey meaningful and effective insights into what you do for the customer.

**I give this book 3 stars**

## [Book 2: How to Focus; Thich Nhat Hahn](https://amzn.to/3JzoLQY)

Thich Nhat Hahn, is often considered as the monk who brought the buddhist principles of mindfullness from tibetian highlands to the rest of the world. In this extremely short, and cheap to buy book contains wisdom that is easily accessible. In the modern age of Dopamine fueled rewards and algorthims exploting that in-built system, this is a refreshing book that implores you to slow down take a deep breath and be mindfull of you actions. With practice of mindfullness one can cultivate concentration and with concentration one can obtain focus and with focus one is in the state of nirvana.

"Even if you only stop and focus on your breathing for a few breaths, or for a minute or two, its very valuable. - Nhat Hahn"

**I give this book 4.5 stars**

## [Book 3: Remember: The Science of Memory and the Art of Fogetting; Lisa Genova](https://amzn.to/3JVExps)

Levaraging her background as a neuroscientist, Lisa Genova attempts to explain in a pragmatic way how are memory works. I have been fascinated by the topic of memory and the neural circuitry behind it. In this book Lisa dwells into the process of memory formation, how the formed memories are stored and the differences between failure in memory recall "the phenomenon of misplacing keys you placed 5 mins ago" versus complex demential diseases such as Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. Our memories have more physical characteristics than we give merit to, and it is improved by giving attention / effort and consolidated by nerual process of encoding. Lisa also encorages not to blame ourselves for our episodic memory, and forgetfulness they are some flaws and necessary evils in the design of our brain's evolution.

 **I give this book 3.5 stars**

 ## [Book 4: Utopia for Realists: And How We Can Get There; Rutger Bregman](https://amzn.to/3YruDAj)

I absolutely loved this book. Utopia for realists, is a solid book on social economics and the human condition. Rutger, has made sound arguments for having a basic universal income and counter arguments of the modern day politicians trope "people will be lazy". The book spans the history of humanity, from mere beginnings of poverty across the world and mass scale pandemics, to the miracles of modern science and how it has impacted our lives. It has accurate historical facts and social experiments that occured in the past and reveiws them and critiques them. The themes are, Universal basic income, End of poverty, why GDP is such a bullshit metric, Shorter work weeks, Banking is true a scam (humans can live without banks btw.), Foregin aid and borders (you can give trillions more if you remove the concept of border security). I am in awe of this book and the data it provides in a easy to read context. I hope to write more like Rutger. I have listed few points and i would highly suggest you pick this book and reimagine the world in a different light.

1. Overhaul the banking and financial sector
2. Abolish tax havens
3. Pay more to people who mould the future like Healthcare, teachers than bankers and lobbyists
4. End bullshit jobs
5. End poverty.
6. If some one calls themself pragmatist, they are faking it... call their bullshit

**I give this book 5 stars**

## [Book 5: Gifts of Imperefection](https://amzn.to/3EvXFHf)

A very insightful book that offers 10 principles that one can use for a fullfiling life. I found it profundly usefull, and will likely read it again. Brene writes about the themes of courage, compassion and actionable advice. In the age of social media and perfect appearances I feel that one has to embrace our imperfections as human beings, The topics resonated with me during a period of minor crisis. I was able to stand up to my fears, exercise courage, and accept that i am imperfect. By accepting that I was imperfect, i was more trying to be compassionate to myself. By re evaluating my self worth, and question the expectations of others on me I tried to develop shame resilience. I feel this is a book that needs to be read and the practices put into place over a long period of time. Ultimately, everyone is trying to live a happy life but bound by expectations and self critisism we are chaining ourselves to misery than living a life filled with compassion, kindness and joy.

**I give this book 4.5 stars**
