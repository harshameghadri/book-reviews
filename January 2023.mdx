## [Book 1: The Life-changing Science of Detecting Bullshit; John V. Petrocelli](https://amzn.to/3DwkJoH)

The core of the book; deals with how to encourage healthy scepticism and call others bullshit. As an avid reader, one should be able to detect bullshit versus reality based on facts. Petrocelli explores and elucidates what sorts of bullshit exist in the real world, whether it is a used car salesman or a de beers diamond for your loved one; With clear examples, he shows us a roadmap to the art of identifying bullshit. 

For example, why would you spend a big chunk of savings to obtain a mined diamond claiming to be rare and of natural origin versus a lab-grown diamond for a fraction of the cost? At the molecular level, they both are the same. So if you have fallen into such traps before and want to learn to avoid this is a great book to start your journey in sniffing out bullshit. Especially in the age of social media, this book gives us a roadmap on evidence and how evidence should be implored of the claimant if you detect that it is bullshit.

**I give this book 5 stars**

## [Book 2: Effortless: Make it easier to do what matters; Greg McKewon](https://amzn.to/3XStMIG)

A lot of us have been burdened by a multitude of tasks, Everyone I know, including me, has faced burnout and a culture where almost exhausting yourself is rewarded or seems to be rewarded. I have been in this loop of trying to be a high achiever and hitting walls of depression when someone else can execute a task that I found challenging. 

Effortless, is a book I would recommend reading over and over again. Greg gives us a set of tools that turn tedious and often daunting tasks into enjoyable rituals, setting a sustainable pace versus going all in all at once, simplifying processes versus a strict I should do these all steps to get this task done. I think effortless is one book when you are facing burnout you might have to read; make a ritual out of it, like give yourself a 20 min read along with your favourite cup of chai or cake. Maybe re-read it, _I will for sure_ after a few weeks because if you are anyone like me, the concepts need to be imbibed in your daily practice and it takes time to become effortless. 

**I give this book 4.5 stars**


## [Book 3: Chatter: The voice in our head, Why it matters, and how to harness it; Ethan Kross](https://amzn.to/3kVC9EW)

Ethan is a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan, The book starts with an episode of paranoia triggered by a letter of threat personally directed to him. In the book; Ethan dives deep into the inner voice whether it is of paranoia or a negative episode that was triggered by an offhanded comment from a colleague. He calls these diverse sets of emotions "Chatter". 

Brilliantly written and quite easy to navigate with equidistant summaries on the topic as he interweaves research in human emotions with real-world examples; Chatter should be a part of the curriculum of studies for students of all ages. Giving the set of tools at an early age, for example, The one I am practising under a negative spiral is to think _"What would Harsha Do?"_ ; This I feel puts a distance between me and the problem I am facing lets me breathe for a moment and think slightly more clearly. He lists 5 strategies one can pursue, and each one of them needs to be explored and employed in our lives.

**I give this book 4.5 stars**
